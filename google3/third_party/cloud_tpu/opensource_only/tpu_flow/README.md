# Experimental code for MLPerf Cloud Infrastructure with airflow
This infrastructure uses Cloud Composer (Cloud version of airflow) to create
customizable workflows for fundamental Cloud TPU tasks (e.g. create a TPU,
run some setup on that TPU, run the workload on that TPU).


The code has migrated to `cloud-tpu` repository in Gerrit.
Run `git clone sso://team/cloud-tpus-dev-team/cloud-tpu/tpu_flow` to access.
